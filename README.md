# rps-animations

Another day, another version! This is an improvement on the previous rock, paper, scissors project where I added more animations. 
I got to practice using the canvas API in javascript and building animations using CSS. This is the continuation of the thrid project in TOP. 

Will you conquer the computer? Test your fate ...

# What I Learned 
  * Used keyframes to move objects and build custom animations to implement on my page 
  * Worked with HTML canvas to build a 2D rendering context object in js. From this, I could build columns and control the size of the characters using
    the .fillStyle and .fillRect methods. 
  * Refactored code that was within the event listener into smaller functions so it is clearer to read
